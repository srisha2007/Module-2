# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

##  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

##  Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```
## Output
<img width="592" height="318" alt="544461520-9673b613-a17d-42c2-a9cb-6c7aab386ee6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d492e655-a6e4-41f8-80cf-6b3de3fbbdcb" />

## Result
Thus, the program to perform Binary Conversion using Built-in Functions in Python was executed successfully.
